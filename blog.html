        <p class="life-story">My name is Aaron, and this is my coding story. I started off once quaratine started, I really had nothing to do, so I decided to get back into coding, this time for real, without any giving up like it happened a couple of years ago, where I thought it wasn't for me. But here I am right now, after less than a month of grinding, writing my first website, completely on my own, with my own design. I grinded really hard for this, and I still am, I want this to be my profession in the future, I'm getting much better at it, I won't stop grinding until I finally get my dream job, master it, and do it for the rest of my life, stay tuned for more of my projects to come along this journey, that you can join with me.
